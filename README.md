# snake_game
This is a game that I recreated using the Pygame library, simulating the classic game Snake. In the game, a snake starts from a random point on the board and can freely move within it. Every time the snake eats food, it automatically grows by 1 unit, which corresponds to one square. The game ends when the snake becomes too long or when it collides with a wall. This game is relatively easy to recreate and can help you understand how to use the Pygame library, utilize certain data structures like tuples, strings, and control flow.
