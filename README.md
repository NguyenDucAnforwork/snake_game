# Description:
This is a game that I recreated using the Pygame library, simulating the classic game Snake. This game is relatively easy to recreate and super appropriate for beginners.

In the game, a snake starts from a random point on the board and can freely move within it. Every time the snake eats food, it automatically grows by 1 unit, which corresponds to one square. The game ends when the snake becomes too long or when it collides with a wall. 

# Through this project we will learn how to: 
1. Create automatic movement of the snake based on given conditions.
2. Utilize certain data structures like tuples, strings, and control flow.
3. Model the coordinates of a snake

# Step-by-step instructions:
1. Draw a grid of squares and model the coordinates of a snake.
2. Use mouse clicks to move - Note that the snake is not allowed to move backwards. 
3. Extend the snake when it eats an apple. 
4. Check for conditions when the snake hits the wall + when the snake bites its own tail. 
5. Display the result; Stop the screen and write a reset command.
